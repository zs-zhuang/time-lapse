This script (simulate_growth.py) simulates the distribution of time to reach a population size N
bacteria divide according to certain distribution
for example, if they divide with exponential distribution, most cells can divide and then divide again immediately
this might be true for starved cells going through cell size reduction
or they might divide with various growth rate that falls into a gamma or gaussian distribution
