time-lapse
===========

# Summary

This repository contains:
- scripts to set up high-throughput automatic time-lapse image collection of bacterial colony growth on petri dish using scanners
- scripts to perform image analysis on time-lapse data set and extract useful information such as colony growth rate and spatial relations etc.
- scripts to simulate colony growth based on hypothetical models that mimics the experimental conditions
(for detailed instruction, please refer to the individual README files inside each sub-directory)
